    <h2>Big Smokey Burgers recipe</h2>
    <p></p>I created this recipe while trying to recreate the best burger I had ever tasted at a restaurant in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. My family and I think these burgers are better! They are packed with flavor!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef sirloin</li>
            <li>Â½ onion, grated</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grill seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon adobo sauce from canned chipotle peppers</li>
            <li>1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, chopped</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>6 (1 ounce) slices sharp Cheddar cheese (Optional)</li>
            <li>6 hamburger buns</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Combine ground sirloin, onion, grill seasoning, liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, adobo sauce, and chipotle pepper in a large bowl. Form the mixture into 6 patties. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
